For any bank or financial organization,fraud detection is of utmost importance. We have to spot potential fraud so that consumers can not bill for goods that they havenâ€™t purchased. The aim is, therefore, to create a classifier that indicates whether a requested transaction is a fraud.

### Statistical data analysis techniques include:

- calculating statistical parameters
- regression analysis
- probability distributions and models
- data matching

### AI techniques used to detect fraud include:

- Data mining classifies, groups and segments data to search through millions of transactions to find patterns and detect fraud.
- Neural networks learn suspicious-looking patterns and use those patterns to detect them further.
- Machine learning automatically identifies characteristics found in fraud.
- Pattern recognition detects classes, clusters and patterns of suspicious behavior.
